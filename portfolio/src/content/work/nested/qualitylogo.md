As the Senior Front-End Developer at QLP for over six years, I was instrumental in shaping the user experience and technical infrastructure of their digital platforms. My core responsibilities revolved around building and maintaining UI components, a CSS design system, supporting a WordPress blog, and working with the SEO team to implement SEO and CRO strategies. I had coded almost 100% of the CSS and Markup for the front end.

I spearheaded the development and maintenance of new pages and UI components, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems and adherence to brand guidelines. By implementing effective SEO strategies, I enhanced our website's visibility on search engines, leading to increased organic traffic and improved user acquisition.

Recognizing the importance of efficient workflows, I built and maintained a streamlined build process that optimized development timelines and fostered collaboration within the team. Additionally, I championed the creation and maintenance of a scalable CSS design system, enabling consistency across projects and simplifying component reuse.

To further improve the user experience, I diligently optimized for Google Core Web Vitals, focusing on enhancing page speed and overall performance. I actively collaborated with cross-functional teams, including designers, backend developers, and QA specialists, to ensure the delivery of high-quality, user-centric web interfaces.

In addition to my core responsibilities, I maintained our WordPress blog, ensuring it remained up-to-date and informative. By developing reusable templates and component libraries, I accelerated development cycles and maintained a high standard of code quality throughout our projects.
